# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The **Singleton Pattern** is a design pattern used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and guarantees that the object is accessible throughout the application. 

In this example, we’ll look at a notification system where a **Notification Singleton Factory** manages the creation of different types of notifications (email, SMS, or push notification) while ensuring that only one instance of the factory is used throughout the application.

## Key Concepts of the Singleton Pattern

- **Single Instance**: The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created. This instance is shared across the entire application.
- **Global Access**: The instance is globally accessible, making it easy to manage resources or configurations that need to be centralized.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when it is first needed, improving performance and resource management.
- **Controlled Access**: The Singleton class typically provides a static method that is used to access the instance. This allows for controlled access to the singleton.

## Code Structure

The structure of a Singleton Pattern setup generally includes:

1. **Singleton Class**: The class that controls the creation and access to the single instance.
2. **Concrete Classes**: Specific implementations of the base class, in this case, the different types of notifications.
3. **Client Code**: The client that accesses the singleton factory to create notifications.

### Example Project Structure

```
NotificationSystem/
├── notifications/
│   ├── notification.py           # Contains the abstract base class and concrete classes
│   └── singleton_factory.py      # Contains the singleton-based factory class
└── main.py                       # Client code that uses the singleton factory to create notifications
```

## Advantages of the Singleton Pattern

- **Ensures a Single Instance**: The Singleton Pattern guarantees that only one instance of a class exists, which can be important for centralized management of resources (e.g., a configuration manager, logging service, or notification manager).
- **Global Access Point**: The singleton instance can be globally accessed throughout the application, reducing the need for passing around multiple instances.
- **Memory Efficient**: Since only one instance is created, the Singleton Pattern can help conserve memory when creating objects is resource-intensive.
- **Controlled Instance Creation**: The pattern allows for the controlled creation of an instance, ensuring that no unnecessary instances are created or initialized.

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is useful when:

- We need to control the creation of a class to ensure that only one instance exists.
- We want to provide a global point of access to an instance of a class (e.g., a configuration manager, logger, or thread pool).
- We want to centralize certain functionality across the application (e.g., managing connections, caching, or a global service).
